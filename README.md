# Point of Sale System

## Overview

The Point of Sale (POS) System is a simple yet powerful application designed to manage sales transactions efficiently. It allows administrators to manage seller accounts, add and manage products, and process sales. The system uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and a SQLite database for data persistence.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login for administrators and sellers.
- **Admin Panel:** Administrators can add new seller accounts and manage products (add, update, delete).
- **Sales Interface:** Sellers can view products, add items to their cart, and process sales.
- **Database Integration:** Uses SQLite to store user and product information.
- **Receipt Generation:** Automatically generates a receipt for each sale.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language for application development.
- **Tkinter:** For building the GUI.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight database for storing user and product data.
- **Hashlib:** For secure password hashing.
